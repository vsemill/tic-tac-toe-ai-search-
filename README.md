# Tic-Tac-Toe AI â€“ Uninformed (DFS) & Informed (Minimax)

This project demonstrates two AI strategies for playing Tic-Tac-Toe:
1. **Uninformed Search (DFS)** â€“ explores moves without heuristics.
2. **Informed Search (Minimax)** â€“ uses game-tree evaluation to choose optimal moves.

Both versions include:
- GUI built with **Tkinter**
- Keyboard navigation support
- "Play Again" restart option

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

### 1. Uninformed Search (DFS)
- Searches possible moves in depth-first order.
- Selects a move if it can eventually lead to a win.
- If no winning path is found, chooses a random move.

### 2. Informed Search (Minimax)
- Evaluates game states using a score function.
- Chooses moves that maximize AI's chances and minimize the player's chances.
- Plays perfectly if allowed enough time.
